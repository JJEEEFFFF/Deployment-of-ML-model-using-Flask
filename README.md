# Deployment-of-ML-model-using-Flask
This document provides an overview of a Python codebase developed to deploy a machine learning model using the Flask framework. The machine learning model is trained on the Iris dataset, a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and data science. The Iris dataset is commonly used for classification tasks and consists of measurements of iris flowers' sepal and petal dimensions, along with their corresponding species.

The primary objective of this codebase is to train a machine learning model capable of predicting the species of iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Once the model is trained, it is deployed as a web application using the Flask framework, allowing users to interactively input the iris flower's measurements and receive predictions on their species in real-time.

This project serves as an example of deploying machine learning models into production environments, enabling seamless integration of predictive analytics into web applications. By leveraging the Flask framework, users can access the predictive capabilities of the trained model through a user-friendly interface, facilitating practical applications of machine learning in various domains.
